# EEE4114F Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning Project

The aim of this project is to classify 5 classes of shapes using a neural network. Various methods are used to test and validate the data, as outlined in the report.

### Jupyter notebooks:
This repo contains jupyter notebooks for generating training and evaluation data as well as adding random rotations, translations, zoom and Gaussian noise to increase the dataset size and variation. 

This repo contains jupyter notebooks for building the neural network and training it on the data. There are evaluation and visualisation methods.
